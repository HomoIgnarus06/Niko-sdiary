        <p>— You know, the two things I enjoy most in the world are math and sex</p>
        <p>— (surprised) What?</p>
        <p>— Yeah.., what? You think I don’t have any sexual connections with females because I like math and I’m a nerd?</p>
        <p>— Kinda…, yeah.</p>
        <p>— (laughs) Well, you’re not wrong. I meant ‘s.a.x’, the saxophone. Not with the one with ‘e’ in the middle.</p>
        <p>— Ohhh..</p>
        <p>Yep, that’s how I met Billy; my flatmate. Those words were what he said after we shared our names and he told me he’s taking a major in Mathematics. It was awkward but it was humorous. I guess, those lines eased the stranger-ness wall between us since the first day.</p> 
        <p>As I got to know more about him, I found out that his humour was not entirely false. He was a great saxophone player, and at the weekends, he went to that bar (I don’t want to name) in Manhattan to play saxophone as a part-timer. People do not just love what he plays, they are completely infatuated by the sound he makes. About the one I said earlier: ‘ I found out what is humour was not entirely false’, I will explain it. He was conventionally handsome in a masculine way, which made women fall for him for one-night stands. Nearly every night or even every night, he had sex with a woman, regardless of their looks (I’m saying this because some of the women he had slept with looked conventionally ugly). However, it didn’t seem like he was enjoying it, but more like doing it out of responsibility or a routine or an order. </p>
        <p>Every midnight, I could see him bringing a woman to our flat (It’s a bit awkward—he once told me he would never have sex with anyone outside of this flat). When the sun rises, that woman will go back to the place where she wants to go instead to this flat and to Billy. Some would even say “goodbye” to me when they see me drinking coffee in the kitchen or in the living room (Don’t ask me what I am doing, it’s not important to the story).</p>
        <p>Sometimes, the woman will leave earlier; after having sex, usually, in fact. On those nights, Billie and I had time. We would go out sometimes and wander on the streets or we would drink wine together and talk about all the things we had in our mind or drink beer and say nothing—just staying still and looking at the room above. And in those times, I would go outside the veranda and light a cigarette. Billie didn’t smoke.</p>
        <p>One day, while he and I were drinking beer and talked about nothing. I went out to the veranda and lit a cigarette as usual. After that, I went back into the room and strangely, I saw Billy hadn't left the living room and had gone to his room. It was quite unusual because as you should have guessed, when I went out to the veranda, Billy went back into his room (he cleared his beer and cleared mine if there was no beer left in my can).</p>
        <p>— Oh.. you haven’t left.</p>
        <p>— Yes, I haven’t</p>
        <p>— Alright (???)</p>
        <p>Then, I went to the kitchen and disposed of my beer can. I opened the fridge and thought for a second.</p>
        <p>— (shouted) Hey Billy, do you want another can?</p>
        <p>— yeah, sure, why not?</p>
        <p>So, I took a can for myself and one for him. After we both opened our cans, we spoke nothing. When half of the beer went into my stomach, I felt like my heart was choking.</p>
        <p>— Hey, about the girl today, who was her?</p>
        <p>— (confused) Who do you mean?</p>
        <p>— The one you slept with, of course</p>
        <p>— Ahhh….. her. (long pause) I think her name is Rachel if I don’t recall it wrong.</p>
        <p>— What?? Are you even forgetting her name? Do you even remember what she looked like?</p>
        <p>— (smiles) No, not really. Her hair’s somewhat short and brown, right?</p>
        <p>— It was brunette. She has a shag haircut. She was wearing light blue baggy jeans, a dark green sweater vest over a white T-shirt and a dark medium-sized Louis Vuitton handbag which is a dupe.</p>
        <p>He nodded and said nothing. I threw out the can in the trash can. As I was about to leave, he said “Nicky...”,</p>
        <p>I turned my head around him and said “Yes?” I could see his hand was shaking, and I could feel the cold sweat on my forehead with my heart— I could see my heartbeats rising. But he said nothing, he said nothing. He turned around and sipped the beer. I pretended like he never called me and went inside my room.</p>
        <p>When I woke up, I saw my pillow was fairly wet— I think I had wept in my sleep. Then, I thought I should have pushed Billy to say something yesterday. I tug my hand on my hair and stroke it. There’s nothing I can do for him, but there’s nothing I can do for myself too.
