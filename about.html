        <h2>ABOUT :</h2>
       <h3>Why I create this</h3>
       <p>There are several reasons why I created this website or webblog. (1) I was bored and had nothing to do. (2) Act as a training project for my web dev projects (3) Just want to write my views and thoughts freely.</p>

       <h3>What am I going to do here?</h3>
       <p>I don't have any specific reasons to do here. Now, I'll write my diariy or log, the name I prefer more, write what I think about on certain books, films and music (might or might not be a review), and my random thoughts</p>
        
       <h3>Against the badthings?</h3>
       <ul>
        <li>On my own blog, you have complete control over my data. Social media platforms store, and <strong> sell user data</strong> to third parties for advertising purposes. So it's a win for both you and me.</li>
        <li>My content will not be subjected to <strong>algorithmic manipulation</strong> aimed at maximizing user engagement for company's profit.</li>
        <li>On my own blog, I am <strong>not bounded</strong> by the content policies of social media platforms</li>
        <li>People use Social media like X(formerly Twitter) to share bite-sized content which is useless. Here, you can see the detailed beliefs of mine on a particular subject. </li>
        <li>I will be copylefting my website so if you want to see the source code, here is the <a href="#" type="_blank">link</a> If you have no idea on what copyleft is check <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyleft" type="_blank">this</a></li>
       </ul>

        <h2>So who am I actually?</h2>
        <p>Of course, this is the most important question which answer you definately definitely need to know to decide will you check my webpages or not. First of all, I'm from Burma who is currently studying in Malaysia. I like to read, think, play chess, and take care of plants. I think that's all I need to say because I don't know what to say anymore. It's not that I don't have anything to say; I have a lot of things to say so I'm bored of writing.</p>
